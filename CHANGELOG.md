# 1.15.0

- Big: Switched backend architecture to use AI SDK over LangGraph. This is a better fit for Nanocoder for many reasons. Thanks to @DenizOkcu for doing this switch.

- Tag files and their contents into messages directly use the `@` symbol. Nanocoder will fuzzy search and allow to choose which files.

- New message streaming to see agent respond in realtime. Toggle stream mode on and off via the `/streaming` command.

- Added Homebrew installation option.

- Improved command auto-complete by adding fuzzy search.

- Improved table rendering in CLI by switching out the custom renderer for the more robust `cli-table3` library.

- Improved non-native tool call parsing by refining the XML/JSON parsing flow.

# 1.14.3

- Added Nix package installation option. Thanks to @Lalit64 for closing issue #75.
- Chore: bumped `get-md` package version to the latest.

## 1.14.2

- Fix: issue #71. Markdown tables and HTML entities are now rendering properly in model responses.

## 1.14.1

- Switched out Jina.ai that fetched LLM optimised markdown from URLs to our own, on-device, private Nano Collective package: [get-md](https://github.com/Nano-Collective/get-md).
- `search_files` tool now ignores contents of `.gitignore` over just a pre-defined set of common ignores.
- If you use OpenRouter as a provider, it now logs "Nancoder" as the agent.
- Fix: Added `parallel_tool_calls` to be equal to `false` in the LangGraph client. This helps bring some stability and flow to models especially when editing files.

## 1.14.0

- Added `/setup-config` command - an interactive wizard for configuring LLM providers and MCP servers with built-in templates for popular services. Includes real-time validation, manual editing support (Ctrl+E), and automatic configuration reload.
- Revamped testing setup to now:
  - Check formatting with Prettier
  - Check types with tsc
  - Check for linting errors with Eslint
  - Run AVA tests
  - Test for unnused code and dependencies with Knip
- The full test suite passes for version 1.14.0 with no errors or warnings. Nanocoder should feel and work more robustly than ever!

## 1.13.9

- Added Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 to model database.
- UI updates to welcome message, status and user input placeholder on narrow terminals.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `pull_request_template.md` to reflect new testing requirements.
- Fix: Declining a tool suggestion and then sending a follow up message caused an error.
- Fix: Removed duplicate `hooks` directories and consolidated into one.
- Fix: Removed unneccessary `ollama` package.

## 1.13.8

- Fix: Issue #55
- Rolling out testing to the release pipeline

## 1.13.7

- Updated `LICENSE.md` to be `MIT License with Attribution`. This was done to keep the spirit of MIT but also ensure the technology built by contributors is properly credited.
- We added a new system prompt with better instructions, ordering, tool documentation and included system information.

  - Old system prompts are dated using the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd-main-prompt.md` where the date is when the prompt was retired.

- Fix: import aliases within the code now use `@/` syntax _without_ file extensions. This is an under-the-hood refactor to improve code readability and use more modern standards.
- Fix: All but the last message in the chat was made static through Ink. This still causes _some_ terminal flicker if the last message was a long one. All messages are immediately made static now to further improve performance.

## 1.13.6

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` and rolled out changelogs to releases.
- Updated the `/clear` command output UI to read "Chat Cleared." over "✔️ Chat Cleared..."
- Refactored `langgraph-client.ts` to removed old methods that are no longer needed. Rolled out this change to `useChatHandler.tsx`. This results in smaller, more tidy files.
- Fix: LangGraph errors leaked through to UI display. This is now tidied to be from Nanocoder.
- Fix: Pressing Escape to cancel model responses was not instant and sometimes didn't work.
