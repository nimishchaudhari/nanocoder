## FAQs

### What is Nanocoder?

Nanocoder is a local-first CLI coding agent that brings the power of agentic coding tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI to local models or controlled APIs like OpenRouter. Built with privacy and control in mind, Nanocoder supports any AI provider that has an OpenAI compatible end-point, tool and non-tool calling models.

### How is this different to OpenCode?

This comes down to philosophy. OpenCode is a great tool, but it's owned and managed by a venture-backed company that restricts community and open-source involvement to the outskirts. With Nanocoder, the focus is on building a true community-led project where anyone can contribute openly and directly. We believe AI is too powerful to be in the hands of big corporations and everyone should have access to it.

We also strongly believe in the "local-first" approach, where your data, models, and processing stay on your machine whenever possible to ensure maximum privacy and user control. Beyond that, we're actively pushing to develop advancements and frameworks for small, local models to be effective at coding locally.

Not everyone will agree with this philosophy, and that's okay. We believe in fostering an inclusive community that's focused on open collaboration and privacy-first AI coding tools.

## Configuration

### AI Provider Setup

Nanocoder supports any OpenAI-compatible API through a unified provider configuration. Create `agents.config.json` in your **working directory** (where you run `nanocoder`):

```json
{
	"nanocoder": {
		"providers": [
			{
				"name": "llama-cpp",
				"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080/v1",
				"models": ["qwen3-coder:a3b", "deepseek-v3.1"]
			},
			{
				"name": "Ollama",
				"baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
				"models": ["qwen2.5-coder:14b", "llama3.2"]
			},
			{
				"name": "OpenRouter",
				"baseUrl": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
				"apiKey": "your-openrouter-api-key",
				"models": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"]
			},
			{
				"name": "LM Studio",
				"baseUrl": "http://localhost:1234/v1",
				"models": ["local-model"]
			},
			{
				"name": "Z.ai",
				"baseUrl": "https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/",
				"apiKey": "your-z.ai-api-key",
				"models": ["glm-4.6", "glm-4.5", "glm-4.5-air"]
			},
			{
				"name": "Z.ai Coding Subscription",
				"baseUrl": "https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4/",
				"apiKey": "your-z.ai-coding-api-key",
				"models": ["glm-4.6", "glm-4.5", "glm-4.5-air"]
			}
		]
	}
}
```

**Common Provider Examples:**

- **llama.cpp server**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080/v1"`
- **llama-swap**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:9292/v1"`
- **Ollama (Local)**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1"`
- **OpenRouter (Cloud)**: `"baseUrl": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"`
- **LM Studio**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:1234/v1"`
- **vLLM**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8000/v1"`
- **LocalAI**: `"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080/v1"`
- **OpenAI**: `"baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1"`
- **Z.ai**: `"baseUrl": "https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/"`
- **Z.ai Coding**: `"baseUrl": "https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4/"`

**Provider Configuration:**

- `name`: Display name used in `/provider` command
- `baseUrl`: OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
- `apiKey`: API key (optional, may not be required)
- `models`: Available model list for `/model` command

**Timeout Configuration:**

Nanocoder allows you to configure timeouts for your AI providers to handle long-running requests.

- `requestTimeout`: (Optional) The application-level timeout in milliseconds. This is the total time the application will wait for a response from the provider. If not set, it defaults to 2 minutes (120,000 ms). Set to `-1` to disable this timeout.
- `socketTimeout`: (Optional) The socket-level timeout in milliseconds. This controls the timeout for the underlying network connection. If not set, it will use the value of `requestTimeout`. Set to `-1` to disable this timeout.

It is recommended to set both `requestTimeout` and `socketTimeout` to the same value for consistent behavior. For very long-running requests, you can disable timeouts by setting both to `-1`.

- `connectionPool`: (Optional) An object to configure the connection pooling behavior for the underlying socket connection.
  - `idleTimeout`: (Optional) The timeout in milliseconds for how long an idle connection should be kept alive in the pool. Defaults to 4 seconds (4,000 ms).
  - `cumulativeMaxIdleTimeout`: (Optional) The maximum time in milliseconds a connection can be idle. Defaults to 10 minutes (600,000 ms).

**Example with Timeouts:**

```json
{
	"nanocoder": {
		"providers": [
			{
				"name": "llama-cpp",
				"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080/v1",
				"models": ["qwen3-coder:a3b", "deepseek-v3.1"],
				"requestTimeout": -1,
				"socketTimeout": -1,
				"connectionPool": {
					"idleTimeout": 30000,
					"cumulativeMaxIdleTimeout": 3600000
				}
			}
		]
	}
}
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

Nanocoder supports connecting to MCP servers to extend its capabilities with additional tools. Configure MCP servers in your `agents.config.json`:

```json
{
	"nanocoder": {
		"mcpServers": [
			{
				"name": "filesystem",
				"command": "npx",
				"args": [
					"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
					"/path/to/allowed/directory"
				]
			},
			{
				"name": "github",
				"command": "npx",
				"args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
				"env": {
					"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"
				}
			},
			{
				"name": "custom-server",
				"command": "python",
				"args": ["path/to/server.py"],
				"env": {
					"API_KEY": "your-api-key"
				}
			}
		]
	}
}
```

When MCP servers are configured, Nanocoder will:

- Automatically connect to all configured servers on startup
- Make all server tools available to the AI model
- Show connected servers and their tools with the `/mcp` command

Popular MCP servers:

- **Filesystem**: Enhanced file operations
- **GitHub**: Repository management
- **Brave Search**: Web search capabilities
- **Memory**: Persistent context storage
- [View more MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

> **Note**: The `agents.config.json` file should be placed in the directory where you run Nanocoder, allowing for project-by-project configuration with different models or API keys per repository.

### User Preferences

Nanocoder automatically saves your preferences to remember your choices across sessions. Preferences are stored in `~/.nanocoder-preferences.json` in your home directory.

**What gets saved automatically:**

- **Last provider used**: The AI provider you last selected (by name from your configuration)
- **Last model per provider**: Your preferred model for each provider
- **Session continuity**: Automatically switches back to your preferred provider/model when restarting

**How it works:**

- When you switch providers with `/provider`, your choice is saved
- When you switch models with `/model`, the selection is saved for that specific provider
- Next time you start Nanocoder, it will use your last provider and model
- Each provider remembers its own preferred model independently

**Manual management:**

- View current preferences: The file is human-readable JSON
- Reset preferences: Delete `~/.nanocoder-preferences.json` to start fresh
- No manual editing needed: Use the `/provider` and `/model` commands instead

### Commands

#### Built-in Commands

- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/init` - Initialize project with intelligent analysis, create AGENTS.md and configuration files
- `/clear` - Clear chat history

#### Custom Commands

Nanocoder supports custom commands defined as markdown files in the `.nanocoder/commands` directory. Like `agents.config.json`, this directory is created per codebase, allowing you to create reusable prompts with parameters and organize them by category specific to each project.

**Example custom command** (`.nanocoder/commands/test.md`):

```markdown
---
description: 'Generate comprehensive unit tests for the specified component'
aliases: ['testing', 'spec']
parameters:
  - name: 'component'
    description: 'The component or function to test'
    required: true
---

Generate comprehensive unit tests for {{component}}. Include:

- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases and error handling
- Mock dependencies where appropriate
- Clear test descriptions
```

**Usage**: `/test component="UserService"`

**Features**:

- YAML frontmatter for metadata (description, aliases, parameters)
- Template variable substitution with `{{parameter}}` syntax
